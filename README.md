# Seismic attributes
Seismic attributes calculation in Matlab.

This code is a read companion for the classic attribute text book: **"Seismic Attributes for Prospect Identification and Reservoir Characterization" by Chopra and Marfurt**. This text book describes many of the classical algorithms, unfortunately often in a verbose and imprecise way, referencing difficult to find and dated papers.

To remediate this, this companion code provides a simple, concise, yet rigorous and consistent approach to the main classical **attribute algorithms** used in Geophysics. The vector and parallel programming makes the code relatively efficient. Also the overhead necessary before one can do actual geophysics is kept to a minimum. It should also be very easy (a matter of minutes) to test any algorithm on any small dataset available in SEGY.

Yet, this simplicity and accessibility is achieved at the cost of some computational efficiency. This code was never intended as a commercial code: it is purely educational. For commercial purposes, do yourself a favor and use a commercial code, or AASPI.
